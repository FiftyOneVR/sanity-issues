# Purpose

This is a public repository for transparently tracking and discussing features for Sanity. While Sanity is closed-source, we aim to be transparent and user-focused, so we welcome feature requests, bug reports, discussion, etc here.

# Voting

Please vote on issues by reacting to the first comment with any combination of the following emojis:

- Rocket - "I cannot use Sanity until this issue is resolved"
- Thumbs Up - "I would like to see this resolved"
- Thumbs Down - "I would dislike if this was resolved" (Meaning you don't think this should be done, not that you'd prefer us to work on other things)
